   * onCancelEvent, onLoadEvent, onLeaveEvent, onUpArrowEvent, onDownArrowEvent, onLeftArrowEvent, and onRightArrowEvent
   * (though generally the above nodes only have one parameter for 'type' which is normally 'topLevelEvent', meaning the
   * game system will handle the event based upon defaults).
   *
   * The XML layout definitions can include zero or more 'object' nodes, which define the general placement and sizes of
   * various components on the screen. Component 'objects' are generally also a 'container' object for other objects; in
   * other words: the placement of some objects are dependent upon others.
