2. Changeable Tile Resolution - Choose from 16x16/32x32/64x64 etc. tiles.

--  This is actually a doable thing, as long as tile size is consistent across the whole project. But, no mix-and-match
    tile sizes across the game, please....

3. Quick Window Edits - Easily by dragging, or changing the position, size, color of the bar, menu, windows, HUD's with
   your mouse instead of scripts

--  This is somewhat doable; I see how the Open RPG Maker project is attempting to do it, with a very simplified screen
    layout designer. The layout objects will either be container components or object components; containers should be
    used to contain other components, even other containers (so that layout is entirely hierarchical). Other components
    would be like the text labels, buttons, selectable elements (check-boxes?) and such.

7. Advanced Message System - does not wait for the player to click so it will go to the next message, and also some
   better Window-skin Settings Which should allow the maker to customize his window

79. message enhancements like bold or italics or strike-through or underline or center/justify would also be nice.

80. return of changing face sides/placing; except a little more, like 'above message box, right/left', 'in message box,
    right/left'.

81. a message box cutoff line that is set at the proper place for English text. Hell, even auto-fix for lines, so that
    we don't keep going over our text again and again. This would be a big help actually, considering most people use
    different fonts and each is a different size. Auto-wrap for text boxes

185. Create text directly in message box instead of previewing text every 10 seconds (e.g. typing dialog in the font
     and letter-spacing in the game instead of Times New Roman)

278. Allow linking a message box's face to the actor graphic.

--  Within definite possibility, though #7 is an odd thing to want; this would make it more like a visual novel engine,
    as in games like "Monster Girl Quest".... The others seem to be asking more or less for more "common sense" control
    of text within a message box, and how it is presented to the player. #185 seems to be about "previewing while using
    the game font" for message-text writing; possible, but on hold.

10. Advanced Map Layer Options

16. Unlimited Map Layers

26. Parallax Layer Support

35. Event Layers

44. Add a Passability Mapping Layer

133. Merging down map layers, and then building on top of that.

155. Unlimited layers for the map... and possibly, being able to place some tiles more freely (like moving upper layer
    tiles in a 16x16 or 8x8 manner rather than the default)

--  Map layers as apparently will be implemented in the Open RPG Maker program, seems to be a nifty idea. I may support
    it; even with multiple layers to develop our maps, we must be aware: memory requirements increase proportionally as
    each layer is added.

29. Default Customization of Title Screen - Include more layer options and animated/scrolling options

61. Setup Main Menu Command Window (In database)

--  Not sure if this means the "Title Screen" commands, or the in-game "Menu Screen" commands, or something else. But I
    think either option would be easily handled, with minimal fuss....

14. XP-Style Mapping


108. Autotiles in RMXP reduce the redundancy of having to shift-click, simply by double clicking the autotile and
     choosing how the edges would work. I do not see why this could not have worked with the autotiles in Ace.
