These following items from the Wikia list, I will view as "Not Doable", by the fact that they are not within the ranges
of what I am attempting -- such as, "I am coding in Java, not Ruby"; or, "my projects will not require this".

110. Passability Changer; PC for short? We'd have the same setup in the database where we could make our tiles X, O, or
     Star by default, but then have an option in the main editor where we could click, choose X, O, or Star, and paint
     them across the map for a specific area we want to behave differently, similar to how we can paint regions. What
     this will do is allow a person to change the passability of a given tile without having to rely on scripts, events,
     or tileset reorganization to create the illusion of walking behind a wall.
     I could set up a wall autotile with X in the database as a default, create the map using this wall, and then click
     on the PC, choose Star, and then paint that across the area of the wall where I want my character to walk behind.

--  I understand what is intended; but this is not a smart way to go about doing it. Instead, consider using map layers
    for designing better pseudo-depth. No need to duplicate wall tiles just so a player character can "walk" behind it,
    partially obscured; we should merely make sure that the bottom wall tiles are on the intended layer, and the upper
    wall tiles are on the layer just above that.
