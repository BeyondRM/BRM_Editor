146. Multi-language support - The ability to export and load all string entries from the game into an tagged text file
     and reload that data after translations, changing the entries in all game fields upon loading.

--  YES. This is one of the main points for creating and expanding upon the RM concept: to allow easier localization or
    internationalization. Although, rather than "exporting" texts during game creation, we will perform some simplified
    I18N/L10N as the very basis of editing the texts within the game proper.

147. Default skills that cost HP. Instead of using events or scripts, you could be able to make your HP a possible cost
     for casting a spell, and it should display how much HP it costs in the menu/battle.

--  An ingenious alternative for skill costs; however, I'm not sure this would lead to the kinds of games that I should
    want to play. Horror games and dark-fantasy games that use a character's health? Ech.
