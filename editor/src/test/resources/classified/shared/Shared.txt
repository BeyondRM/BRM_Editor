11. Auto-tile options - Allow for curved corners or corner options

46. Non-Squarish Autotiles and map edges.

--  Enabling "curved corners" or other corner options may be a unique feature to develop (someday), but in the meantime
    this is a bit difficult to handle. My implementation of the "A" tile sheets will probably undergo a revamp, to the
    extent of not being 1:1 backwards compatible with RPG Maker tilesets/tilesheets; curved corners might be a worthy
    feature to consider....
    To some extent this depends upon the graphic format; to others, it depends upon what kind of "curved corner" we are
    talking about -- what radius? how many tiles per corner? how to handle intermediate corner designs?

28. Built in Animated Battlers

32. Larger/More RTP Resources

127. Make RTP more portable

218. Asset stores

--  Much of this is, in specific, asking for more "default" included assets, or asking to make them accessible via some
    alternative distribution method. While some of that may be possible, an "asset store" is merely a collection of art
    and media made by third-party persons; implementation of this requires further thought.
