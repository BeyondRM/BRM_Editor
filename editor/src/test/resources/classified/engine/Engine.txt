5. More Default Battle Systems

158. More battle systems e.g. front, side views.
    - On-map battle/ABS battle system (Legend of Zelda)
    - Charge turn battle system (Final Fantasy X)
    - Active time battle system (Final Fantasy VI)
    - If possible, but not a priority - Tactical battle system (Fire Emblem)

--  I do plan to allow for more than one battle system to be used, through abstract parent classes that merely provide
    the battle-system basics; the specifics may be designed by overriding those classes with battle system methodology.
    The ones that are more difficult to develop might be those that are not so linearly turn-based, i.e., a more "real
    time" battle system.

17. Event Collision - (for when one event touches another)

--  Possible to an extent; we don't want characters to pass through each other. But on the other hand, having collision
    detection and processing in the Editor for event-making, and then in the Engine for performing custom actions after
    a collision, ... let me think on that, some more.

22. Built in MiniMap Options

--  Quite doable. The main concern is "scale": what size on screen of mini-map relates to what size viewable area, that
    is larger than the normal viewable area on screen? For maps which wholly reside on screen (one-room maps) shall not
    need a mini-map; but to the other extent, will a maximum-size map (512x512) be abstracted into a small rectangle of
    64x64 pixels?

101. Options Menu.
    No more "F1" which is something that does not blend with the rest of the game and is not customer-friendly at all.
    But instead a full, accessible options menu from the main menu and title screen, containing at least the following:
      full screen on/off (with choice saved for later uses, by default: on)
      mouse control on/off (idem)
      musics and sounds on/off
      view animations on/off

--  Agreed. An options menu should be quite easily created (in terms of initial coding) to allow configuring preference
    and setting values. Typically: Audio, Video, Controls, Game. These are usually self-explanatory, and divide all the
    options into several pages of configurable instances.
