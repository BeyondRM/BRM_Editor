/**
 * <h2>brm.editor.activity</h2>
 * A package for the Activity tab contents. This package contains classes meant for the Editor's Activity tabbed panel,
 * which contains sub-tabs for the specific project and meta-project information.
 * <p>
 * The {@link ActivityControls} class is for meta-editor controls and information; for example, at some future point it
 * might be a good thing to do like NetBeans IDE's "Start Page" where RSS feeds et cetera could be shown.
 * <p>
 * The {@link ActivityHelpHints} class might be useful for showing HTML documentation in the editor; it is useful for
 * keeping information at the user's fingertips, whenever possible.
 * <p>
 * The {@link ActivityProjectData} class is where the active project's details may be summarized.
 * @see ActivityControls
 * @see ActivityHelpHints
